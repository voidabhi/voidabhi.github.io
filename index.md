Hi, my name is **Abhijeet Mohan** , and I'm a software developer at **Styzilla**.

My current location is **Bangalore, India**.

On the web and with friends, I am also known as **voidabhi**, which has been my nickname since long time.

I am a regular **opensourcer**. Here is my [Github account](https://github.com/voidabhi)

I am also into **information designing** :). Checkout my work at [Indian Hustlers](http://www.indianhustlers.com)

Also, i have been featured [here](http://www.miet.ac.in/image/iipc-best-it-project.pdf) and [here](http://blog.venturesity.com/hackathon-diaries-stayzilla).

You should probably also know that I do not have a sleep schedule, which means that I am usually **awake** whenever there is work to do.

You can contact me through my email address, **void.aby@gmail.com**.

You can also say "hi" to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/voidabhi), where I post professional and personal thoughts.
